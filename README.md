## Comments

### Summary:

- After enter `/` url User is redirected to the `/profile`
- User is able to upload any image type avatar, only restriction is the size: 2MB
- I've decided to store User avatar as base64, because app is not connected to any API
- Another solution for that could be stored an avatar as image file at Client side.
- I've decided to use Style-components because I wanted to play with it.
- CSS Modules are also good solution to style components in React.
